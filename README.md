# Handwritten Text Recognition with TensorFlow

Small project on developing a Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) System over a Streamlit Web Application. Using pre-trained models implemented on TensorFlow and trained on the IAM off-line HTR dataset. These models take **images of single words or text lines (multiple words) as input** and **output the recognized text**.

The **images are obtained by extracting it from a box (canvas) in which the user can draw** on the Streamlit app.
